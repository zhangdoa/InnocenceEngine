# REMOVED PLAYGROUND CODE

This folder contains documentation of code that was removed from the test framework during refactoring.
These implementations were experimental/playground code that is not part of the core engine.

## AtomicDoubleBuffer (Removed)

**Removed from:** Original Test.cpp  
**Reason:** Playground/experimental code, not part of core engine functionality  
**Description:** Template class implementing double-buffered atomic operations

```cpp
template <typename T>
class AtomicDoubleBuffer
{
public:
	AtomicDoubleBuffer() = default;
	~AtomicDoubleBuffer() = default;

	void Initialize(const T& rhs);
	Atomic<T>& Get();
	void Flip();

private:
	mutable std::shared_mutex m_Mutex;
	std::atomic_bool m_isANewer = true;
	Atomic<T> m_A;
	Atomic<T> m_B;
};
```

**Associated Test:** TestAtomicDoubleBuffer() - Also removed as it tested experimental code

## StackAllocator (Removed)

**Removed from:** Original Test.cpp  
**Reason:** Playground/experimental code, not part of core engine functionality  
**Description:** Simple stack-based memory allocator implementation

```cpp
class StackAllocator
{
public:
	explicit StackAllocator(std::size_t size) noexcept;
	~StackAllocator();
	
	void* Allocate(const std::size_t size);
	void Deallocate(void* const ptr);

private:
	unsigned char* m_HeapAddress;
	unsigned char* m_CurrentFreeChunk;
};
```

**Associated Test:** TestStackAllocator() - Also removed as it tested experimental code

## Task Scheduling Utilities (Removed)

**Removed Functions:**
- `CheckCyclic()` - Placeholder function that always returned false
- `Submit()` - Template function for task submission
- `DispatchTestTasks()` - Complex task dispatching with DAG structure

**Reason:** These were incomplete implementations used only for testing concurrent scenarios, not part of the actual engine task system.

## Complex Test Infrastructure (Removed)

**Removed from original Test.cpp:**
- Complex task graph building with dependency management
- Incomplete thread-safe task execution framework
- Placeholder implementations for production task scheduling

**Why removed:** These were stub implementations that don't represent the actual engine's task system and could be misleading for developers.

## Refactoring Benefits

**What we gained by removing playground code:**
- **Cleaner codebase** - Focus on testing actual engine components
- **Less confusion** - No experimental code mixed with production tests
- **Better organization** - Professional test structure without distractions
- **Clearer purpose** - Tests now validate real engine functionality only

**New Professional Structure:**
- **UnitTests/** - Core functionality validation
- **PerformanceTests/** - STL vs custom implementation comparisons
- **StressTests/** - Concurrency and large-scale testing
- **Common/** - Reusable test infrastructure

**Refactoring Date:** 2025-05-29 [Recreated]  
**Refactored By:** AI Code Architect  
**Standards Applied:** v1.1 (No inline functions with engine API dependencies)  
**New Structure:** Tests organized by category with proper header/implementation separation
