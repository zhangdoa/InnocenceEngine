## AI Agent Team Process
AI agents use temp file workflow:

1. Create message in `AI Agent Team/commit-message.txt`
2. User reviews code changes and commit message
3. User approves and then AI agents execute commit with `git commit -c AI Agent Team/commit-message.txt`
4. Reuse temp file for next commit

## Example
```
Fix ObjectPool memory leak with proper destructor

Resolves critical memory leak where ObjectPool heap was never deallocated,
causing accumulating memory usage in long-running applications.

- Add destructor with proper heap deallocation
- Add null pointer safety check  
- Use engine memory management system
- Add debug logging for allocation tracking

## Enforcement
- **AI commits require attribution** - missing attribution blocks commit
- **Attribution scope** - indicates who authored code and/or message
- **Git history transparency** - clear distinction between human and AI work
