written in 1-2 sentences for better readability and context.

### Key Requirements:
- **Subject line**: Imperative mood, under 72 chars, no period
- **Description**: 1-2 sentences explaining what/why
- **Bullet points**: Specific changes made
- **AI attribution**: `Code-AI-Generated-By: [AI System Name]` - **MANDATORY**
  - **SCOPE**: This attribution indicates the entire changelist (code + commit message) was AI-generated
  - **FORMAT**: Must be the exact final line of the commit message
  - **CLARITY**: Distinguishes from human commits and specifies full AI authorship

### Examples:
```
Fix ObjectPool memory leak with proper destructor

Resolves critical memory leak where ObjectPool heap was never deallocated,
causing accumulating memory usage in long-running applications.

- Add destructor with proper heap deallocation

## üö® **ENFORCEMENT**

- **All AI commits MUST include attribution** - commits will be rejected without proper `Code-AI-Generated-By` footer
- **Code review process checks attribution** - missing or incorrect attribution blocks merge  
- **Git history transparency** - ensures clear distinction between human and AI work
- **Professional documentation** - maintains project integrity and legal clarity
- **Scope clarity** - `Code-AI-Generated-By` indicates entire changelist is AI-authored (code + message)

This policy ensures transparent, professional commit history with unambiguous AI attribution.
