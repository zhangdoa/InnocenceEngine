## ðŸš¨ **ENFORCEMENT**

- **All AI commits MUST include attribution** - commits will be rejected without it
- **Code review process checks attribution** - missing attribution blocks merge  
- **Git history transparency** - ensures clear distinction between human and AI work
- **Professional documentation** - maintains project integrity and legal clarity

This policy ensures transparent, professional commit history with proper AI attribution.
